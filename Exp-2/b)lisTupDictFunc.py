# Defining a list, tuple, and dictionary
# Printing the list, tuple, and dictionary
print("List:", my_list)  # Printing the list
print("Tuple:", my_tuple)  # Printing the tuple
print("Dictionary:", my_dict)  # Printing the dictionary
# The above code demonstrates how to work with lists, tuples, and dictionaries in Python
# Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable, and dictionaries store key-value pairs
# The list can be modified, the tuple cannot be changed, and the dictionary allows for key-value pair access
